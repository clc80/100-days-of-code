# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 29 October 13, 17

**Today's Progress**: My first day of coding my app, I say first because I had to take a break. Help! For some reason when one letter is selected that is in the word it will show all the letters in the word

**Thoughts:** I was making decent progress. I was able to add a file with a list of words but they I couldn't figure out how to show that one word so I said I'll work with just one word for now. I was able to hide the word and asterisks instead of letters. I was able to get the user to input a letter and to check to see if the letter is a part of the word. If the letter is not it will list the letters and eventually it will deduct one guess. However I ran into a problem where if the user enters a letter that is in the word, instead of it only showing the one letter it will show the whole word. I couldn't figure out what I did wrong so that was where I had to stop for the day. 

### Day 28 October 12, 17

**Today's Progress**: Not much computer coding but spent 3+ hrs working on how to make my hangman app. A lot of arrows were drawn.

**Thoughts:** I have a starting plan and I know how it's going to work. I started with a bit of the logic. It really helped to bread down the whole game into small chunks and then I can work on those small chunks indiviudally.  

### Day 27 October 11, 17

**Today's Progress**: Back to swift. Working on a hangman game. Not a tutorial, but trying to figure it out based on what I have learned.

**Thoughts:** I spent alot of time feeling overwhelmed and not knowing how to start. I understand what I want to do and how hangman works but I have no idea how it's going to work. I had to reread a few of the previous chapters to even think about starting. 

### Day 26 October 10, 17

**Today's Progress**: CSS layout for code camp assignment. I forgot how time absorbing CSS can be. I spent 20 minutes in the Nav and footer

**Thoughts:** Finished up the website. The last bit of it was making sure that there was a standard throughout the 4 pages and that everything looked the way I wanted it to. 

### Day 25: October 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Sent the past two days packing and moving. Today I got back into coding. Tried to do some HTML and CSS, boy was I rusty.

**Thoughts:** It's a simple 4 page website for a robot store. The elements of the HTML page were given to me, I had to do the styling. 

### Day 24: October 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Unsuccessfully wrapping my head around  GCD functions, in particular  async() I'm not even sure I know what it does.

**Thoughts:** I finished the project from Hacing with Swift but I think I get it, I'm just not sure. It's about having the device do the work on the back end. Somehow. 

### Day 23: October 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: At this stage it's easier to restart than to try and debug my app I can debug later when I have an idea of what i'm doing

**Thoughts:** I was on a roll with this swift learning until I got to the word-guessing game and for some reason I can't get my program to read my file. I figured since I don't know exactly where I made a mistake I'd just start over. I went through the project faster the second time

### Day 22: October 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: No swift today, slight change today to pg 1 of 4 of a CSS project I did read up on previous chapters to refresh myself

**Thoughts:** Sticking through with the boot camp for now. 

### Day 20 & 21: September 28 & 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Super simple javascript project http://thecoderpilot.com/ClaudiaMacielProject1/index.html â€¦ and working on my first iPad game. Super simple too.

**Thoughts:** I enrolled in a bootcamp and this was my first project. Not that hard, but I don't know if I want to stay in it. Do I really want to do full stack development? I really want to stick with Swift. Can I do both? 

### Day 19: September 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my API app, I'm very confused on how API's work. Any resources on the subject would be greatest appreciated.

**Thoughts:** This is definetely something I need to look into more, seems very useful but very confusing. 

### Day 18: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**:I had to restart app 2x it was easier that figuring out the error. Using JSON with swift. Trying to anyways.

**Thoughts:** JSON gave me problems when I was working with it on Free Code Camp. I made it work but I don't know if I could recreate what I did. 

### Day 17: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my second swift app It's a shopping list app. The hardest part was adding two buttons to the top nav bar

**Thoughts:** It me forever to figure out how to do it. Maybe the way I was googling for the answer was not right. I need to pay attention to the lingo more. 

### Day 16: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back to Swift, Next project is working with autolayout and I was just getting used to ctrl+drag, now it's done via code

**Thoughts:** It was a challenge to ctrl and drag on my mac book pro. And then you tell me I could've done this via code all along.

### Day 15: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Slight change of pace. Updated my website still need to add my work but it's coming together http://thecoderpilot.com/new 

**Thoughts:** I want to be able to show what I am doing and somehow I want to add my swift projects to my portfolio, but first I have to add my other projects to my portfolio. I need to find some time and just do it. 

### Day 14: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: What am I doing wrong? I am trying to see if the word has at least 3 characters in it But the error says count is unavailable

**Thoughts:** I've tried stackoverflow, hacking with swift and other random google answers. Nothing seems to work. I'm quitting for now. 
Update: of course as I give up and am laying in bed the answer pops up. I am using the wrong version of swift.  I was still using swift 3 and word.characters.count works for what I was trying to do.

**Today's Progress, after my moment of trouble**:  Added all the suggested changes to my anagram app except for number 4 because I am not sure what it's asking.

**Thoughts:** I'm so proud of myself, I was able to logically think my way through the modifications and I knew what I wanted to do and where to find the answer. 

### Day 13: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Anagram app is complete the next step is to find ways to make it different (tomorrow). Today I am glad that it works.

**Thoughts:** Here lies the problem, I can follow a tutorial and I can understand what I am reading but can I make it work when I have no guidance? 

 ### Day 12: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on an anagram app w/ #swift Trying to understand closures I read the words copied the code & understood nothing

**Thoughts:** I've reread this chapter multiple times and I still don't under\stand what the closure is and how it works. I think I do but then I realize I don't. What can I find to help with this? 

### Day 11: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: One missing line & my app worked but not correctly present(ac, animated: true) was missing and then when i realized it

**Thoughts:** I blame this on not taking the time to understand what I am copying, but blindly copying the book. I will take the time to read and understand what I am doing. 

### Day 10: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: So frustrating when the error is a logic error and not a syntax error. My code runs but not the way I want it to.

**Thoughts:** Working on the browser app Project 4 was not easy, I did it but wasn't sure what I was doing and that made the learning a bit harder.

### Day 9: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 1st App Challenge completed successfully. Not much to the app but it works and I did it.

**Thoughts:** I created an app that has a table list of countries and when the user clicks it, it opens up a picture of the flag. The user is then able to share it. Woop, Woop!!

### Day 8: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Does it count as "I have learned" if for a challenge I looked up the steps from the previous readings?

**Thoughts:** At least I knew what I was looking for and not googling "How to..." 

### Day 7: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Celebrating my first non-tutorial challenge with swift. I nailed both the syntax and the logic. Oh yeah!! Woop woop!!

**Thoughts:** Logic is easy for me and the syntax makes sense. It's the figuring out what to do that seems to be getting to me. I can't be too hard for myself. I have come a long way in 10 days. 

### Day 6: September 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a label to display the score on the screen. I did this without the tutorial. This was all me and google!

**Thoughts:** Some parts are sticking and I can understand it a bit more. I know what to do and where to look but still not straight from my head. 

### Day 5: September 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my first simple game using swift. Nothing fancy nor complicated, but I did it and it works and that is a win!

**Thoughts:** I'm noticing a pattern here, so much for doing this everyday. I seem to be doing everyother day. 

### Day 4: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day4 not too much time to code but I did get in some design work on my second project, still a win!!!

**Thoughts:** Should I study design, too? When will I be able to sleep. Too much too fast, I have to slow down and focus. 

### Day 3: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished app #1, working on the second one a game using UIKit, and learn about integers, buttons, colors and actions.

**Thoughts:** How much can I do bymyself if I was asked to recreate the same app I just did. Probably none. 

### Day 2: September 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: My app is coming along except that I have no idea what I did. It works, but how did it work is the question.

**Thoughts:** The problem that I seem to have is knowing what I should know. I can follow along with the book but I feel like I'm not learing enough. I guess we all have to start somewhere. 

### Day 1: September 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Trying out the Hacking with Swift book and @udacity Day1 building a picture view app

**Thoughts:** Feels good to get back into it, but this time I will do what I have wanted to do and not what people think I should do. iOS developement here I come. 

**Link to work:** Don't know how I will put my work up for swift.
